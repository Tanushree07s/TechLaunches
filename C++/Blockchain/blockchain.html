                Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts stored on a blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                A smart contract is coded with predefined "if-then" rules and deployed
                to the blockchain, becoming public, immutable, and ready to respond.

              <li>
                A user initiates a transaction (e.g., sends payment), which the smart
                contract continuously watches for on the blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the contract’s conditions are met, it auto-executes the specified action
                (e.g., sends an asset). If not, it remains inactive.
              </li>
              <li>
                All interactions and outcomes are permanently recorded on the blockchain,
                allowing anyone to verify the process without relying on a third party.

                    must use both UTXOs (since they can't be split). You'll spend the $10 and
                    $5, and receive a new $3 UTXO as change. After the transaction, you're
                    left with only a $3 UTXO.

          Adding a Transaction to a Blockchain (Part 3)

            <ul>
              <li>
                A fork is when the blockchain splits into two separate chains (two different
                versions of truth).
              </li>
              <li>
                This can happen if two validators or miners create valid blocks at the
                same time, or due to delays in how blocks are propagated across the network.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some nodes may receive one block first, while others receive a different
                one — leading to a temporary divergence.
              </li>
              <li>
                The network continues building on both chains until one becomes longer.
                At that point, the longest chain is accepted, and the shorter one is discarded.
              </li>
              <li>
                To ensure their transaction stays on the final chain, recipients wait
                for multiple confirmations (blocks built on top) before accepting it as
                final.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transactions in the discarded chain are returned to the mempool.
              </li>
              <li>
                These can be included in future blocks — unless the coins were already
                spent in a confirmed transaction on the main chain, in which case the original
                transaction becomes invalid and is dropped.
              </li>
              <li>
                Creators (miners/ validators) of the discarded blocks do not recieve their
                rewards. This is because a reward is only considered final if a block becomes
                part of the accepted main chain.

              <li>
                Double-spending occurs when someone attempts to use the same cryptocurrency
                in two different transactions.
              </li>
              <li>
                This leads to a fork in the blockchain.
              </li>
              <li>
                The blockchain only allows one of these transactions to be confirmed.
                The first one added to a block becomes valid, while the other is rejected.
              </li>
              <li>
                To protect against this, recipients often wait for multiple confirmations
                (i.e., blocks added on top of the one containing their transaction). This
                makes it increasingly difficult to reverse or tamper with the confirmed
                transaction.
